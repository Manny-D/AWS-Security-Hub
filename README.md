<br>

## Description

This lab was part of an online course that provided an overview of [Amazon Web Services Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/), looked at specific Findings and created a Custom Action that allowed us to send a notification to our Security Operations Center (SOC) team. 

AWS Security Hub is a cloud security posture management (CSPM) service that performs security best practice checks, aggregates alerts, and enables automated remediation.

<br>

## Integrations

Security Hub integrates with various providers (3rd party and AWS services) that allow the import and / or export of findings. It normalizes and aggregates the ingested data and acts as a single pane of glass to help understand the security and compliance posture of our AWS account(s). 

To check on what integrations are supported, on the left pane, click on <b>Integrations</b>. 
You can search for an integration or scroll down the list. Then click on <b>Accept findings</b>. 

<b>Note</b>: for managed services, many AWS services will already be enabled to accept findings. For 3rd party providers, some may need to be purchased and require configuration prior to being able to Accept findings.

## Findings

Here is where Security Hub will report any failed security checks and security issues that are detected across the AWS resources.

From here, the security team will need to decide how to take action. For the purpose of this lab, weâ€™ll be setting up a custom action that allows us to notify the Security Operations Center (SOC) on selected findings.
