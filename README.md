## Description

This lab was part of an online course that provided an overview of the [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/), where we created a Custom action to address specific Findings, utilizing AWS EventBridge and AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) to manually send out a notification.

<br>

## Security Hub: Summary 

Upon accessing AWS Security Hub, we are presented with the Summary page, a dashboard showing our security score (total and by standard) as well as the <b>Resources with the most failed security checks</b>.

![Summary Dashboard](https://github.com/Manny-D/AWS-Security-Hub/assets/99146530/7d0da267-549e-4447-a8dd-d8b84cbfedd4)

<b>Note</b>: Security Hub continuously checks our resources against security best practices. 

To view more details about a specific security standard, click on it. <br>
eg. <b>AWS Foundational Security Best Practices v1.0.0</b>

![Standard overview](https://github.com/Manny-D/AWS-Security-Hub/assets/99146530/cc5a8102-00ba-437d-b6ef-77a8f3814780)

We can see why the <b>Compliance Status</b> is showing as <b>FAILED</b> by clicking on the hyperlinked <b>Title</b>.

Along with the additional details, recommended <b>Remediation instructions</b> are available!

<br>

## Security Hub: Security standards 

This is a section where you can also view the results for a specific security standard, as well as configure and enable the other available <b>Security standards</b>. 

![Security standards](https://github.com/Manny-D/AWS-Security-Hub/assets/99146530/087dab56-7eeb-425f-88f7-6b0a9a40c98b)


<br>

## Security Hub: Insights Section

Security Hub displays several related findings here, which help to assess our security posture and quickly identify risks. 

![AWS Insights](https://github.com/Manny-D/AWS-Security-Hub/assets/99146530/f7c83c8e-b765-4a25-8f59-f1db920e00a3)

<br>

## Security Hub: Integrations 

Security Hub integrates with various providers (3rd party and AWS services) that allow the import and / or export of findings. It normalizes and aggregates the ingested data and acts as a single pane of glass to help understand the security and compliance posture of our AWS account(s). 

To check on what integrations are supported, on the left pane, click on <b>Integrations</b>. 
You can search for an integration or scroll down the list. Then click on <b>Accept findings</b>. 

<b>Note</b>: for managed services, many AWS services will already be enabled to accept findings. For 3rd party providers, some may need to be purchased and require configuration prior to being able to Accept findings.

<br>

## Security Hub: Findings 

This is where Security Hub will report any failed security checks and security issues that are detected across our AWS resources. 

![AWS Findings](https://github.com/Manny-D/AWS-Security-Hub/assets/99146530/2a2aa2f4-129a-49fa-a5f8-fcf280018460)

From here, the security team will need to decide how to take action. For the purpose of this lab, weâ€™ll be setting up a custom action that allows us to notify the Security Operations Center (SOC) on selected findings. 

<br>

## Security Hub: Settings 
 
On the left pane, click on <b>Settings</b> -> <b>Custom actions</b>.

![Custom actions](https://github.com/Manny-D/AWS-Security-Hub/assets/99146530/df907ecb-328d-4f31-923b-74846142119d)


In the pop-up, enter in an <b>Action name</b>, <b>Description</b> and <b>Custom actin ID</b> -> then click <b>Create custom action</b>.

![Create custom action](https://github.com/Manny-D/AWS-Security-Hub/assets/99146530/5600cbaa-9522-48d3-91b4-b648c00461c0)


It will now be listed.

We now need to link this Custom action to an Event Bridge rule.

<b>Note</b>: Be sure to copy the Custom action ARN, since it will be needed for the next step!

## Conclusion

Security Hub is a cloud security posture management (CSPM) service acting as our central dashboard for cloud security. It continuously checks AWS resources against security best practices and compliance standards.  

![AWS Security Hub](https://github.com/Manny-D/AWS-Security-Hub/assets/99146530/11b8bc8f-ce28-46cd-b20c-e6f8ce138b73)

It aggregates findings from various AWS security services, giving us a unified view of our security posture and highlighting potential security issues. This allows us to proactively address and remediate them, thus improving our overall security posture.
